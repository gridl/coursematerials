# Course Materials

This is where you will find all the datasets, as well as .R and .ipynb codes for my two e-courses, "Regression Analysis Using Python", and "Regression Analysis Using R".

The e-books for the course are available for free on my website through subscribing to my weekly data science mailing list: http://www.michaeljgrogan.com/data-science/
