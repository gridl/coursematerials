1. Make sure you have the Jupyter Notebook installed to open the .ipynb (Python) files. You can download the Jupyter Notebook at http://jupyter.org. However, make sure you also have Python itself installed.

2. For the R codes, it is best to work with these through RStudio, which can be downloaded at https://www.rstudio.com. However, make sure you also have the R language itself installed.

3. For the Python course:

a. ols.ipynb and ols_stock2.csv are used for the Ordinary Least Squares regression section of the course.

b. logisticregression.ipynb and binomial_stock.csv are used for the Logistic regression section of the course.

c. arima.ipynb and hypostock.csv are used for the ARIMA section of the course.

4. For the R course:

a. ols.R and ols_stock2.csv are used for the Ordinary Least Squares regression section of the course.

b. glm.R and binomial_stock.csv are used for the Logistic regression section of the course.

c. arima.R and jnj.csv are used for the ARIMA section of the course.
